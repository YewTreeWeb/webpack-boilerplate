# Webpack Boilerplate
This is a simple Webpack boilerplate. It only configures JS with Babel and a Webpack dev server. Hopefully a good starting point to adding CSS loaders and a JS framework of your choice.

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:
```
npm install

yarn
```

## Scripts
```
npm run build / yarn run build

npm run serve / yarn run serve
```

## Browserlist

To define your own set of supported browser's for Babel read the Browserlist [documentation](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)
